# Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose
***
To develop a workday planner with daily schedule where user can save events for each hour of the work day. It will run in the browser and have a clean, responsive and intuitive user interface. 

&nbsp;


## Desired
***
- Upon opening, current day is displayed at top
- Upon scrolling down, presented with standard business-hour time blocks
- When time blocks are viewed, each is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future
-  When a time block is clicked, can enter an event and click save button to save it (ie text saves to local storage)
- When refresh the page, saved events persist
